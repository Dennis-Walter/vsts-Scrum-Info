VSTS extension that provides information on backlog items, aggregating SP, #items, work

### Version History

0.1.18 - 1.0 MVP, with the information showed in a popup.
```

# Case 

### Problem

*   In TFS is not possible to count SP, work, effort.    
*   This feature is not standard in VS, and
*   The next versions of TFS will be fully web-based.

### Solution

*   Provide a web-based Scrum Info extension 
*   to get a summary of a backlog
*	Alternative : 
     * The Scrum Power Tools for Visual Studio 2013 IDE extension, 
     * but the plugin is not updated anymore for newer VS versions

### Value

*   Less excel sheets
*   Team productivity increase
*   Get rid of the cumbersome task of counting SP
*   Get to know Roche (VS marketplace)

### Advantage

*    It's the first one to do this in TFS web,
*    It's the only available for TFS 2015/2017
*    We own the code/features

### Channels

*    Roche TFSprod/TFStest web interface
*    Visual Studio Marketplace

### Target

*   Delivery member who wants to gknow progress 
*   SM/SPL/PO who is calculating capacities, velocities to plan and review sprints
*	Early Adopter & requirements: Javi

### Cost

*    1 Dev, 48 innovation man-hours for this MVP 1.0 

### Revenue

* Immediate time savings on productivity for PO/SM/SPLs in DCA and in Roche:
    * Half day per sprint (approx)
